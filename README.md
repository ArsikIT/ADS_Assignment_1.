# Tasks - Java Recursive Methods

This project contains a set of recursive methods written in Java that perform various tasks, including finding the minimum value in an array, calculating averages, checking prime numbers, calculating factorials, and more. The methods are designed to demonstrate how recursion can be used to solve common computational problems.

## Features

The following recursive methods are implemented in the `Tasks` class:

1. **findMin(int[] arr)**  
   Finds the minimum element in an array of integers.  
   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array.

2. **avrg(int[] arr)**  
   Calculates the average of the elements in an array of integers.  
   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array.

3. **isPrime(int n)**  
   Checks if a number is prime.  
   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the input number.

4. **factorial(int n)**  
   Computes the factorial of a given number using recursion.  
   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the input number.

5. **fibonacci(int n)**  
   Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.  
   Time Complexity: O(2^n), where n is the input number.

6. **power(int a, int n)**  
   Computes a raised to the power of n.  
   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the exponent.

7. **reverse(int n)**  
   Recursively prints an array of integers in reverse order.

8. **isDigit(String str, int start)**  
   Checks if a string consists only of digits.  
   Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.

9. **binomial(int n, int k)**  
   Computes the Binomial Coefficient using recursion.  
   Time Complexity: O(2^n).

10. **gcd(int a, int b)**  
    Finds the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.  
    Time Complexity: O(log n).
